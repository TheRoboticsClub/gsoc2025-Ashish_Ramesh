    "content": "Hey everyone!This week continued the Phase One of my GSoC project with JdeRobot, where I‚Äôm working on porting the Follow Line exercise to use ROS 2-native code inside Robotics Academy.Objectives for the Week  Clarify whether we should skip prepare_RA_code() or not  Understand BT Studio vs RA exercise structure  Decide: new exercise vs modifying the current one  Make Follow Line work with rclpy.spin()What I Worked OnWe kicked off the week with a sync-up meeting with the mentors to review progress and set technical goals.Weekly mentor sync-upFrom there, I focused on clarifying whether ROS 2-native migration should create a new exercise or extend the existing one. After prototyping and analyzing system dependencies like lap.py, gui.py, and how prepare_RA_code() is tightly coupled with the exercise flow, I concluded that modifying the existing Follow Line exercise would be the more scalable and cleaner approach.Why?  Modifying the current setup keeps system architecture intact.  Key features like the GUI and lap tracking would require major rework otherwise.  Future ROS-native migrations will also be easier this way.I got ROS 2-native logic running with rclpy.spin() inside the exercise. Here‚Äôs what I updated:  Modified the linter to check for either a while True loop or presence of rclpy.spin().  Tweaked prepare_RA_code() to ensure spin-based code runs as expected.  Temporarily skipped add_frequency_control() for now, since there‚Äôs discussion around a newer frequency management method.rclpy.spin() logic running inside the Follow Line exerciseI‚Äôll be checking in with my mentors to confirm whether this is the right direction for the ROS 2 integration and also to better understand how frequency control is expected to be handled going forward.Additional WorkOutside the main objectives, I also explored:  Creating a GUI publisher node, so the user can publish processed images to a topic and have them show on the web frontend. The topic is working, but threading and lifecycle bugs remain ‚Äî still a work in progress.  Implemented basic logging redirection to the terminal inside the Docker container. Currently, logs don‚Äôt show on the VNC GUI console. I‚Äôll check if this behavior is intended or something to fix.Key Learnings &amp; Outcomes  Learned how RAM handles linting and code patching (especially the while True check)  Understood the importance of maintaining compatibility with existing utilities like lap.py and GUI  Validated that rclpy.spin() can work inside the current flow with minimal structural changes  Raised and resolved two tickets this week related to exercise structure and rclpy.spin() integration.Thanks for reading! Next week, I‚Äôll finalize how to structure the GUI topic subscription and revisit frequency control to integrate it cleanly with ROS-native logic.Until next week ‚ÄîAshish"

    "content": "Hey everyone! This week officially kicked off the GSoC 2025 coding period! I‚Äôm thrilled to be contributing to JdeRobot through the project:‚ÄúRobotics-Academy: Support for Solutions Directly Using ROS 2 Topics.‚ÄùObjectives for the Week  Understand how the RAM backend handles user code execution (on_run_application() and prepare_RA_code())  Run ROS 2-native code inside the Follow Line exercise  Verify if the robot responds correctly using native ROS logicWhat I Worked OnStarted the week with a Q&amp;A meeting with all GSoC contributors and the GSoC team.GSoC Q&amp;A SessionAfter the call, I dove into understanding how the current system runs submitted code.I explored the backend of RAM (Robotics Academy Manager) and how it manages Docker containers and code injection through:  on_run_application()  prepare_RA_code()Then, I moved on to testing if ROS 2-native code could run inside the Follow Line exercise. I set up a simple publisher using rclpy to move the car forward.The good news, it worked! This confirmed that ROS 2 logic is executable within the current Robotics Academy flow.ROS 2 logic in action!Currently, the node still requires a while loop. My next step is to refactor it to use rclpy.spin() for a proper ROS 2 event-driven structure and implement frequency control logic ‚Äî possibly with user-configurable options (need to check with mentors on that!).Key Learnings  Understood RAM‚Äôs internal lifecycle and how it injects and runs user code  Confirmed that ROS 2-native logic can work without HAL  Identified a path forward to restructure execution logic using callbacks and rclpy.spin()  If you‚Äôre familiar with running ROS 2 nodes inside restricted Docker environments and have tips, feel free to share!Thanks for reading! I‚Äôll be working on replacing the loop and cleaning up the ROS 2 integration next week.Stay tuned ‚Äî exciting stuff ahead!Until next week‚ÄîAshish"

Set up my local development environment.  Have a one-on-one project discussion with my mentors.Community Bonding Meet (Organization-wide)We had our first group session with mentors and all selected contributors. It was an insightful and welcoming kickoff! The agenda included:  Overview of JdeRobot and the main ongoing projects.  Flash introductions from students and mentors (some cool and diverse backgrounds!).  Discussion on work methodology and best practices.  An open Q&amp;A session to clarify doubts.First Mentor MeetingLater in the week, I had my first sync-up with my project mentors. We covered a lot of ground, including:  A brief history and structure of the RoboticsAcademy project.  An overview of the plan and timeline for my project.  Setting up a consistent workflow including weekly scrums and blog updates.  Deciding on tasks to start with during the first coding week.  Q&amp;A to clear up technical and workflow-related queries.That‚Äôs all for this week! The bonding phase has helped me settle in and prep for what‚Äôs ahead. I‚Äôm excited to dive into the code next week as we kick off the coding phase üöÄUntil next week‚ÄîAshish"
