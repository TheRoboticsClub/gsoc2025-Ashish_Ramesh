    "content": "Hey everyone! This week officially kicked off the GSoC 2025 coding period! I‚Äôm thrilled to be contributing to JdeRobot through the project:‚ÄúRobotics-Academy: Support for Solutions Directly Using ROS 2 Topics.‚ÄùObjectives for the Week  Understand how the RAM backend handles user code execution (on_run_application() and prepare_RA_code())  Run ROS 2-native code inside the Follow Line exercise  Verify if the robot responds correctly using native ROS logicWhat I Worked OnStarted the week with a Q&amp;A meeting with all GSoC contributors and the GSoC team.GSoC Q&amp;A SessionAfter the call, I dove into understanding how the current system runs submitted code.I explored the backend of RAM (Robotics Academy Manager) and how it manages Docker containers and code injection through:  on_run_application()  prepare_RA_code()Then, I moved on to testing if ROS 2-native code could run inside the Follow Line exercise. I set up a simple publisher using rclpy to move the car forward.The good news, it worked! This confirmed that ROS 2 logic is executable within the current Robotics Academy flow.ROS 2 logic in action!Currently, the node still requires a while loop. My next step is to refactor it to use rclpy.spin() for a proper ROS 2 event-driven structure and implement frequency control logic ‚Äî possibly with user-configurable options (need to check with mentors on that!).Key Learnings  Understood RAM‚Äôs internal lifecycle and how it injects and runs user code  Confirmed that ROS 2-native logic can work without HAL  Identified a path forward to restructure execution logic using callbacks and rclpy.spin()  If you‚Äôre familiar with running ROS 2 nodes inside restricted Docker environments and have tips, feel free to share!Thanks for reading! I‚Äôll be working on replacing the loop and cleaning up the ROS 2 integration next week.Stay tuned ‚Äî exciting stuff ahead!Until next week‚ÄîAshish"

Set up my local development environment.  Have a one-on-one project discussion with my mentors.Community Bonding Meet (Organization-wide)We had our first group session with mentors and all selected contributors. It was an insightful and welcoming kickoff! The agenda included:  Overview of JdeRobot and the main ongoing projects.  Flash introductions from students and mentors (some cool and diverse backgrounds!).  Discussion on work methodology and best practices.  An open Q&amp;A session to clarify doubts.First Mentor MeetingLater in the week, I had my first sync-up with my project mentors. We covered a lot of ground, including:  A brief history and structure of the RoboticsAcademy project.  An overview of the plan and timeline for my project.  Setting up a consistent workflow including weekly scrums and blog updates.  Deciding on tasks to start with during the first coding week.  Q&amp;A to clear up technical and workflow-related queries.That‚Äôs all for this week! The bonding phase has helped me settle in and prep for what‚Äôs ahead. I‚Äôm excited to dive into the code next week as we kick off the coding phase üöÄUntil next week‚ÄîAshish"

I also reached out to my mentors, joined the community Slack, and got familiar with how things work at JdeRobot.We have our first official team meeting next week, where we‚Äôll go over logistics and finalize timelines.I also had the opportunity to attend the Google Summer of Code 2025 Contributor Welcome Session hosted by Google, which was a great way to learn more about the program and what‚Äôs ahead.  Stay tuned for weekly updates as I begin development in the coming weeks!"
