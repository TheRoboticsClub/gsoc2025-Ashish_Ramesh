<!-- > Hello!
{: .prompt-tip } -->

Hi, I'm Ashish Ramesh, a GSoC 2025 contributor working with JdeRobot on the project 

**‚ÄúRobotics-Academy: Porting Exercises to Native ROS2 with Direct Topic Integration ‚Äù.**

This blog is where I‚Äôll be documenting my weekly progress, thoughts, blockers, and takeaways throughout the summer. The goal of my project is to help bring native ROS 2 support to Robotics Academy exercises, making them more aligned with real-world robotics development practices.

Feel free to follow along as I share updates each week. üöÄ
