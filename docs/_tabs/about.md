<!-- > Hello!
{: .prompt-tip } -->

Hi, I'm Ashish Ramesh, a GSoC 2025 contributor working with JdeRobot on the project 

‚ÄúRobotics-Academy: Support for Solutions Directly Using ROS 2 Topics‚Äù.

This blog is where I‚Äôll be documenting my weekly progress, thoughts, blockers, and takeaways throughout the summer. The goal of my project is to help bring native ROS 2 support to Robotics Academy exercises, making them more aligned with real-world robotics development practices.

Feel free to follow along as I share updates each week. üöÄ
