We had our first group session with mentors and all selected contributors. It was an insightful and welcoming kickoff! The agenda included:

- Overview of JdeRobot and the main ongoing projects.
- Flash introductions from students and mentors (some cool and diverse backgrounds!).
- Discussion on work methodology and best practices.
- An open Q&A session to clarify doubts.

Later in the week, I had my first sync-up with my project mentors. We covered a lot of ground, including:

- A brief history and structure of the **RoboticsAcademy** project.
- An overview of the plan and timeline for my project.
- Setting up a consistent workflow including weekly scrums and blog updates.
- Deciding on tasks to start with during the first coding week.
- Q&A to clear up technical and workflow-related queries.

Thatâ€™s all for this week! The bonding phase has helped me settle in and prep for whatâ€™s ahead. Iâ€™m excited to dive into the code next week as we kick off the coding phase ðŸš€

Until next weekâ€”
