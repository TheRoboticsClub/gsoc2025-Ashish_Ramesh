Hey everyone! 
This week officially kicked off the **GSoC 2025 coding period**! I'm thrilled to be contributing to **JdeRobot** through the project:  
**“Robotics-Academy: Support for Solutions Directly Using ROS 2 Topics.”**

---

### Objectives for the Week

- [x] Understand how the `RAM` backend handles user code execution (`on_run_application()` and `prepare_RA_code()`)
- [x] Run ROS 2-native code inside the Follow Line exercise
- [x] Verify if the robot responds correctly using native ROS logic

### What I Worked On

Started the week with a **Q&A meeting** with all GSoC contributors and the GSoC team.

After the call, I dove into understanding how the current system runs submitted code.  
I explored the backend of **RAM (Robotics Academy Manager)** and how it manages Docker containers and code injection through:

- `on_run_application()`
- `prepare_RA_code()`

Then, I moved on to testing if **ROS 2-native code** could run inside the Follow Line exercise. I set up a simple publisher using `rclpy` to move the car forward.  
The good news, **it worked!** This confirmed that ROS 2 logic is executable within the current Robotics Academy flow.

Currently, the node still requires a `while` loop. My next step is to **refactor it to use `rclpy.spin()`** for a proper ROS 2 event-driven structure and implement frequency control logic — possibly with user-configurable options (need to check with mentors on that!).

### Key Learnings

- Understood RAM’s internal lifecycle and how it injects and runs user code
- Confirmed that ROS 2-native logic can work without HAL
- Identified a path forward to restructure execution logic using callbacks and `rclpy.spin()`

Thanks for reading! I’ll be working on replacing the loop and cleaning up the ROS 2 integration next week.  
Stay tuned — exciting stuff ahead! 

Until next week—
